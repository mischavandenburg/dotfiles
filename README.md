# Mischa's Dotfiles

My dotfiles are not publicly available any longer.

As my setup has increased in complexity, I was tired of the overwhelming amount of questions that came my way from the public.

My entire setup has developed to a fully OS-independent workflow based on dev containers.

If you are interested in learning about this workflow, you can join [my DevOps community.](https://skool.com/kubecraft)

I have a full course available there that will teach you how to build this set up for yourself.

Also, community members get access to my full dotfiles repo, which is now private.
